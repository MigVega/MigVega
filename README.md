- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel.
- 👀 I’m interested in SLAM, Localization and Mapping with or without reference maps (such as 3D BIM Models, point clouds or floor plans), LiDAR and Visual-inertial Odometry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about sensor fusion and pose estimation.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on accurate long-term localization and mapping.
